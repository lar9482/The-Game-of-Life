# Reflection
I wrote this back during my freshman year, when I barely had any coding experience.

I'm keeping this public to help showcase how far I've come as a programmer.

Ok, I'm only a senior, so not that much in the grand scheme of things. It's the thought that counts.

So, please forgive the awful code :)
